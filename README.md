# PetPaws üêæ

PetPaws is a platform built on Django with the MVT architecture. It's designed to connect pets, specifically dogs and cats, with potential adopters. Users can browse, search, and adopt pets, or they can register to add pets for adoption and to track their listings and adopted animals.

## Features

- **Browse Pets**: Users can view a list of available pets for adoption.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific breeds or other keywords to find the perfect pet.
- **User Registration & Login**: While anyone can adopt a pet without registering, users need an account to add pets for adoption. This also allows them to track their listings, adopted animals, and to contact other users.
- **Pet Listings**: Each pet has its own listing which may include details such as breed, age, and more.
